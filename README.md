# Pokedle

A Wordle-style guessing game covering every Pokémon from Gen 1 to Gen 9, including regional forms, Megas and Gigantamax.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # local dev server
npm run build      # static production build in dist/
npm run preview    # serve the production build locally
npm run test       # unit tests
npm run fetch-data # rebuild src/data/pokemon.json from PokéAPI
```

## Project layout

```
scripts/fetchPokemonData.ts   builds the local Pokémon dataset from PokéAPI
src/components/               Header, SearchBar, GuessGrid, FeedbackRow, WinModal, HelpModal
src/hooks/usePokedle.ts       game state (target, guesses, status)
src/lib/                      dataset loading and game logic
src/config/gameConfig.ts      game settings, including which form categories are enabled
src/data/pokemon.json         generated dataset (committed, so the app needs no API at runtime)
```

## Dataset

`npm run fetch-data` pulls every Pokémon entry from PokéAPI (1,351 at the time of writing: 1,025 species
plus regional forms, Megas, Gigantamax and other alternate forms) and writes `src/data/pokemon.json`.
If pokeapi.co is unreachable it falls back to PokéAPI's static mirror on GitHub
(`PokeAPI/api-data`); set `POKEAPI_SOURCE=live` or `POKEAPI_SOURCE=mirror` to force one.
Responses are cached in `scripts/.cache/`.

Known data quirks:
- Colour comes from the species, so forms share it (Alolan Vulpix is listed as Brown, like Vulpix).
- Eternamax Eternatus has no official weight and is stored as 0.

## Turning form categories on or off

Every entry has a `formCategory` (`base`, `regional`, `mega`, `gmax`, `cosmetic`, `other`).
Set any of them to `false` in `src/config/gameConfig.ts` to remove them from the game.

## Deploying

The app is a fully static site with no backend. The build uses relative asset paths,
so `dist/` works on Vercel or Netlify (build command `npm run build`, output `dist`) and on
GitHub Pages under a sub-path.

## Analytics (Supabase)

Anonymous player analytics run on a Supabase Edge Function. From the repo root:

```sh
npx supabase link --project-ref <project-ref>   # connect this repo to your Supabase project
npx supabase db push                            # create the tables, views and daily roll-up job
npx supabase secrets set ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://lucasphanpersonal.github.io,http://localhost:5173"   # sites allowed to send events (set BEFORE deploying)
npx supabase functions deploy track --no-verify-jwt   # deploy the event-collecting function
```

Secrets take effect on the function's next start; redeploy after changing them.

See [supabase/README.md](supabase/README.md) for details.
